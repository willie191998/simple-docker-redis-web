# Simple-docker-redis-web-site

This repository, developed during my **Docker and Kubernetes training on Udemy**, is a simple project showcasing a visitor counter web app using Redis. The application consists of a basic web app that tracks the number of visitors and a Redis container deployed using Docker. 

The project demonstrates fundamental Docker concepts, including containerization, networking, and communication between containers. It serves as a practical example for beginners looking to understand how to integrate Redis with a web application in a containerized environment.
